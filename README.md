 Should work on iOS 14.0-16.1.2 with [CVE-2022-46689](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213532) Exploit
 
 Warning: Changes are permanent on iOS 14.0-14.8.1 and not tested!

Not very beautiful, but should work ;)

Steps:
1. Install with Trollstore, sign it yourself or sign it via service provider
2. select your image(s) or do nothing and the default Wallpaper will be selected
3. press the Replace Button(s)
4. wait till loading is finisched or app crashed
5. if image is shown in "System Light/Dark Wall" connect to carplay and select the light/Gray Wallpaper (should be the third one i think)


**Bugs:**
- Image is black: Repeat step 2
- App crash-> Image is to big or size is wrong (I don't know exactly what is the problem ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜¤), please try to edit the image, choose an other or download image from Github (see below)

**Example Images at Github**
[Images](https://github.com/xqf400/CarMacDirtyCow/tree/main/Images/TestImages)
Or open "Example Images" in the app Info on your device.
