# CarMacDirtyCow

The 2 images are the default images 

Steps:
1. select image
2. press the light or dark button
3. wait till app crashes
4. open app again and look if image changed
5. (optional) if image is still the old image repeat the steps, it can take 3-5 times 
6. connect to carplay

Bugs:
Image is black: Repeat the steps

Not working reboot device🤷‍♂️

Ignore the console😅

**Might not work for the first time! Try a few times**
